{"prev": "A: Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? B: Sure . First of all , it \u2019 s very important for you not to be late .

A: Yeah , that's very important . B: So you \u2019 d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . A: I \u2019 ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . B: That \u2019 s right .

B:", "cur": " It \u2019 s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed .

", "future": "A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . B: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . A: It \u2019 s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . B: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . A: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . B: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . A: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . B: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior ."}
